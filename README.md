Welcome to My GitHub! 👨‍💻🚀🌌
Hi there! 👋
I'm a passionate developer driven by my love for coding, my fascination with the world of cryptocurrency, and my endless admiration for anime. 🖥️💰🎌

Every day is an adventure as I strive to explore new technologies and expand my horizons. Whether it’s building modern web applications, or crafting anime-inspired projects, I bring my energy and creativity to every line of code. 🚀

💻 What I Do
Frontend Development: Turning ideas into interactive and visually stunning web experiences (✨ Tailwind CSS fan here!).
Web Projects: Creating responsive and dynamic web applications, often with Next.js and Drizzle ORM.
Crypto Enthusiast: Building tools, tracking markets, and exploring the potential of blockchain.
Anime-Inspired Coding: Designing projects that celebrate my favorite shows and characters. 🎨
🚀 Current Goals
Mastering backend development with Next.js.
Exploring more about Turso databases and improving my skills in modern ORMs.
Building a portfolio to showcase my best work.
🌱 What I Believe
“Code is not just a tool; it’s a way to express creativity, solve problems, and connect with the world.”

I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and growing. If you’re as excited about coding as I am, let’s connect and create something amazing together! 🌟
